# Everything Ubuntu (or Linux, or whatever..)
This repository will contain mostly guides and some scripts that I wrote and use on my linux machine (currently Ubuntu 17.10).  
The main purpose of this repository is as a central place to store this stuff for myself, but feel free to use and edit everything.  
If you want to redistribute and give me some credit it is appreciated, but in now way required.  

# Table of Contents (I will try to keep this up to date)  
* Setting up gnome3 on Ubuntu based distros [here](ubuntu_setup_gnome3.md)
